PyCitySchools problem
----------------------------
Created a Python script using Jupyter Notebook within VS Code for the PyCitySchools problem, that reads in the students_complete.csv and schools_complete.csv files and calculates the following analysis:

* High-level snapshot of the district's key metrics
* Summarized key metrics about each school
* School Performance based on Percentage of Overall Passing
* Math and Reading Scores by Grade
* Scores by School Spending, School Size, and School Type
